# APK Connection Issue - Fix Applied

## Problem Solved
The APK was failing to connect to the backend server because of conflicting network configurations that were trying to connect to local IP addresses instead of the deployed backend.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated API Configuration (`src/config/index.ts`)
- **Before**: Mixed configuration with local IPs and deployed URLs
- **After**: Consistent use of deployed backend URL: `https://bookswap-yb6p.onrender.com/api/v1`
- **Result**: Both development and production builds now use the same reliable backend

### 2. Fixed Network Utils (`src/utils/networkUtils.ts`)
- **Before**: Only tried local IP addresses, causing APK connection failures
- **After**: Prioritizes deployed backend, falls back to local only in development
- **Result**: APK will always try the working deployed backend first

### 3. Cleaned API Service (`src/services/api.ts`)
- **Before**: Had `reconfigureNetwork()` method that could override the correct URL
- **After**: Removed automatic reconfiguration, added simple connection test
- **Result**: No more URL overrides that could break APK connectivity

## Verification Steps

### 1. Test the Backend (Already Verified ✅)
```bash
curl https://bookswap-yb6p.onrender.com/health
# Should return: {"status":"healthy","environment":"development","version":"1.0"}
```

### 2. Build and Test APK
```bash
cd BookSwapMobile
# For Expo managed workflow:
expo build:android
# OR for EAS Build:
eas build --platform android
```

### 3. Check App Logs
When testing the APK, look for these console logs:
- ✅ `API Configuration: { platform: 'android', apiUrl: 'https://bookswap-yb6p.onrender.com/api/v1' }`
- ✅ `✅ Using deployed backend`
- ❌ Should NOT see: `Testing connection to 192.168.x.x:8000`

## Debugging Options

### If APK Still Has Issues:

1. **Check Network Permissions** (in `app.json` or `AndroidManifest.xml`):
   ```json
   {
     "expo": {
       "android": {
         "permissions": ["INTERNET", "ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Enable Network Security Config** (for HTTP in development):
   Add to `app.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "expo": {
       "android": {
         "usesCleartextTraffic": true
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Test Connection Manually**:
   Add this to any screen for debugging:
   ```typescript
   import { apiService } from '../services/api';
   
   const testConnection = async () => {
     try {
       const result = await apiService.testConnection();
       console.log('Connection test result:', result);
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Connection test failed:', error);
     }
   };
   ```

## Expected Behavior Now

- **Web Build**: ✅ Works (uses deployed backend)
- **APK Build**: ✅ Should work (uses same deployed backend)
- **Development**: ✅ Works (uses deployed backend, no local IP issues)

## Backend Status
- **URL**: https://bookswap-yb6p.onrender.com
- **Health Check**: https://bookswap-yb6p.onrender.com/health
- **API Base**: https://bookswap-yb6p.onrender.com/api/v1
- **Status**: ✅ Online and responding correctly

The connection issue should now be resolved. The APK will connect to the same deployed backend that works perfectly in the web build.
